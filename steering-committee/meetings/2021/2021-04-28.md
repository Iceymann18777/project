3. MDN Content updates
    - See [MDN Editorial Meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ANeo9ZlQMLPrX_4xsQXkItEnXCAOJYoVQQrZqLQEKlI/edit#) from Monday
    - (Florian) Specification section work 
        - Feedback needed: How to render the data-driven specification section? [https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/4482](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/4482) 
        - Will probably land a table for now but it would be great to think how a more fancy spec section should look like in the future
        - Mike says two thirds of the spec urls we have are in BCD. Getting there!
    - (Florian) API docs conventions: Syntax boxes for properties? [https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/4476](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/4476) feedback welcome.
    - (Florian) Continuing to work on making syntax blocks more beginner friendly [https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/26](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/26). About 50% done in the JS docs.
    - (Will):
        - wrote up a more systematic approach to Markdown conversion, showing where we are right now: [https://gist.github.com/wbamberg/10b512e2a35874bfe043740b7fd9790d](https://gist.github.com/wbamberg/10b512e2a35874bfe043740b7fd9790d) (will find a better home for it)
            - Dom: how does it relate to the direction of using structured reusable content with linting?
            - Will: helps somewhat, but mostly orthogonal
            - [discussion on how to work toward that goal with incremental steps, [https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/34](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/34) filed to follow up]
        - fixed up the way we represent notes in the JS docs, so we can convert them more reliably: [https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/4504](https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/4504)
