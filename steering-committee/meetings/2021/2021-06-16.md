    -   Overview [https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/42](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/42) 
    -   We assessed the WebXR proposal [https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/35](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/35) 
    -   New proposals:
        -  [Update HTTP area (HTTP/2, HTTP/3, more guides about features like CSP, migration to MD)](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/43)
        -  [Use webref as the source for CSS formal syntax, instead of mdn/data](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/44)
    -   Please submit more proposals until the end of June
4. MDN/BCD updates
    -   Survey on MDN contribution experience: [https://qsurvey.mozilla.com/s3/MDN-Content-Contribution-Experience](https://qsurvey.mozilla.com/s3/MDN-Content-Contribution-Experience) 
    -   (Eric) Is there a way to do BCD checks locally, before pushing to a PR?
        -   (Dominique) [browser-compat-data/contributing.md at main · mdn/browser-compat-data](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/main/docs/contributing.md)
    -  Markdown:
        -   Testing the JS MD is going on in [https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/5193](https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/5193), 
        -   Talked to Sphinx about l10n impact
        -   Working on updating CSS (removing live samples and inline styles).
        -   Expect we won’t ship this in June because of vacations, but should be early July
    -   Dashboard / query language for BCD? [https://mdn-compat-data-explorer.herokuapp.com/](https://mdn-compat-data-explorer.herokuapp.com/) used to exist, but no longer. (Philip)
        -   Dominic: If I could have anything, it would be something that relates BCD entries to WPT or other test suites.
        -   Dominique: It might be useful if we could annotate WPT tests as relevant to some BCD entry.
        -   Philip: [&lt;wpt> in Bikeshed](https://tabatkins.github.io/bikeshed/#testing) is another thing that usually comes up.
        -   Dominique: I also have a [tool that links Web IDL to tests](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-test-infra/2020OctDec/0002.html): [https://github.com/dontcallmedom/wpt-coverage-tracker](https://github.com/dontcallmedom/wpt-coverage-tracker)
