## Agenda

1. (Florian) Reminder: First Q3 planning session right after this call to discuss OWD work items for July, August, September. 
    - Will report from this meeting async and also in next week’s call for folks who can’t make it today.
2. Welcome Ruth John to the SC!
3. (Florian/Will) Working on publishing the OWD May worklog post this week. 
4. MDN/BCD content updates
    - (Florian) Thoughts on rolling out BCD-powered specification sections everywhere to finish [https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/24](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/24)?
        - Go ahead!
    - (Florian) Preview browsers, PR against Yari filed: [https://github.com/mdn/yari/pull/3997](https://github.com/mdn/yari/pull/3997) 
    -  (Philip) Bar for adding new documentation on MDN and BCD data
        - [Allowing preview browsers](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pull/10334) has raised the question at Google about the bar for accepting new MDN pages or BC`D entries. Would something that’s only in a preview browser be accepted? We’re hoping not, but is this an agreed-upon guideline for both docs and BCD?
            - (Florian) The MDN guideline for new content is here: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Conventions_definitions#when_to_document_new_technologies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Conventions_definitions#when_to_document_new_technologies) 
    - (Will) Markdown: 
        - Gregor has fixed all the outstanding conversion/rendering issues we had and Prettier formatting is working for tables
        - Drafted a plan for shipping the JS docs in Markdown: [https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/5808](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/5808) 
        - Asked people to try out the docs and report issues: [https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/5193](https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/5193) 
        - Contacted Sphinx to discuss the impact on locales, will meet on Monday
        - Crowd-sourcing WebAPI updates was very successful: [https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/5438](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/5438) : 258/268 pages have been cleaned of inline styles.  Thanks to @hamishwillee, @teoli2003, @Blakelist7. We should do more of this  :).
5. (lola) Community enablement
    - 2021 events

## Notes / extras

-   Philip: What's the bar for adding new documentation (MDN and BCD?). We should have a convention / guideline about this.
    -   Dom: stable and on a standards track.
    -   Florian: It depends. Temporal is huge so starting documentation early is needed. Smaller things not so much. MDN’s guideline is good generally.
    -   Mike: beyond developer needs there are other needs: for w3c we care about whether something is implemented not necessarily shipped.
    -   Robert: when there is hype around new features people want documentation for it even if it’s not yet usable. So again: it depends, we might allow exceptions. So are the guidelines accurate or should they be extended to cover such cases?
    -   Mike: including all-false features has a maintenance cost. We should not put things into BCD unless there is at least one implementation.
    -   Robert: agreed, but what about MDN pages? Should we have the same rule?
    -   Mike: yes, why is it a priority to document on  MDN something that no one can use? But if we allow this on MDN we should not then require BCD  entries for every page. We should also not allow mdn_url links that are 404.
    -   Eric: with Temporal, if we put stuff in MDN without BCD, we get broken BCD tables, but if  we put it in BCD without MDN, we get 404s. So it’s catch-22.
    -   Ruth: the only reason for having content without BCD is if people are documenting things that aren’t implemented. But that should be an exception.
    -   Robert: Sometimes there is an expectation that hyped features should be documented even if they can’t be used yet, and MDN not  having them makes it look incomplete.
    -   Eric: We were talking about a way to indicate this on MDN, to discourage people from adding BCD.
    -   Lola: but the experimental banner doesn’t get updated and tends to get out of date. So we would need a systematic way of updating this when the situation changes.

-   Lola: thinking of events we could have this year. 
    -   Thought of having a day around Write the Docs. One in US and one in Australia. Should we contact WtD to ask? 
    -   Everyone: yes!!
