 ## Notes
- Content updates: 
    - BCD: (Philip) Google will be resuming Vinyl’s contract \o/. Philip is preparing a doc on BCD future: would like to get help with reviews and to connect up with other parts of the ecosystem. 
- Project planning:
    - Dom: add [https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/3917](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/3917) and interactive examples for Web APIs for consideration?
    -  We decide what to work on in the planning meetings, which Florian is now chairing
    - In last week’s planning meeting we ranked the existing proposals, modernizing the JS Learn area was the top choice.
-  (Eric) is nearly ready to submit a PR for Temporal.
    - Is there a PR checklist? No, just go ahead.
    - should we/can we include a polyfill for Temporal? Florian: this is an existing issue on MDN, and also there’s the question of whether we could automatically load the polyfill so people can play with it in the page.
    - Should we have a macro that tells people the thing isn’t implemented anywhere? Eric: this is likely to happen to other techs in the future. (Will) this is quite an unusual case, might be worth special-casing it.
