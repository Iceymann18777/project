## Agenda / notes

1. (Florian) February worklog to be published until end of week (likely tomorrow)
    - [Draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yDHUAOyNFFzuevX3pNecIwhKQ_N5iBFkyWfksIMxVDA/edit#)
    - Let Florian know if there is anything to add or you have feedback.
2. (Florian) OWD project planning. Presenting and assessing ideas in GitHub issues
    - Examples:
        - [Mixin docs on MDN](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/23)
        - [Up-to-date & machine readable specification links on MDN and in BCD](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/24)
        - [Convert MDN content to Markdown](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/25)
        - [Making MDN syntax boxes beginner friendly](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/26)
        - [Fix how MDN distributes Polyfills](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/27)
    - Feedback on this format?
        - Great! 
        - Task list is not really needed. High-level overview is enough.
        - If these are PRs, we can have a discussion and save them as project docs.
    - Aiming to add more ideas in March so that we can decide and pick a few of them for a OWD / Mozilla shared roadmap starting with Q2.
3. (Florian) SC call next week: Who would be up to for staying 30 minutes longer?
    - The GC meets next for a longer discussion and it would be good to reflect on thoughts a bit in an extended SC call.
    - Majority of attendees are able to stay 30 minutes longer next week.
    - Will likely deep dive into project planning and metrics.
4. MDN Content update
    - See also [MDN Editorial Meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ANeo9ZlQMLPrX_4xsQXkItEnXCAOJYoVQQrZqLQEKlI/edit#)
    - (Chris) Came up with solution for mdn code example licensing issue
    - (Chris) Tier 1 locales very near to being unfrozen
